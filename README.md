# Image-Processing-in-Java
## Created as a project in 4th Semester. Code does the following : 
#### 1.Opens an Image whose directory and name is mentioned in the code 
#### 2.Create a "Negative Image" of the Original 
#### 3.Saves the Negative Image to a Directory Mentioned in the code. 

## One of the First Java Project that I have worked on. 

## Future Plans to work on when free :  
#### 1.Add Main Menu and More Features/Options to Modify the Image(Like Saturation+,Black and White,etc) 
#### 2.Allow the user to Navigate through the directories,Choose an Image that they want.
#### 3.Allow the user to save the new image to the directory they like. 
#### 4.Allow user to modify multiple images at a single run.
